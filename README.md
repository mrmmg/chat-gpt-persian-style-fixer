# OpenAI Chat Page Persian Text Fixer
Enhance your experience on the OpenAI (ChatGPT) chat page with this Persian style fixer. It improves the readability of Persian text, making your reading experience more enjoyable!

## Why?
Right-to-left languages, such as Farsi, are not widely used by many people, and popular services often do not support right-to-left styles or text views. Similar to other services, the OpenAI chat system (known as ChatGPT) faces challenges in displaying Farsi language correctly. However, this issue can be resolved through a simple CSS style direction.

This Chrome/Edge extension fix this issue for you.

## Installation Instructions

**Google Chrome / Microsoft Edge**

1. Download this repo as a [ZIP file from GitHub](https://github.com/mrmmg/chat-gpt-persian-style-fixer/archive/master.zip)


2. Unzip the file and you should have a folder named `chat-gpt-persian-style-fixer-master`


3. In Chrome/Edge go to the extensions page (`chrome://extensions` or `edge://extensions`)

4. Enable Developer Mode (Top-Right of page)

5. Drag the `chat-gpt-persian-style-fixer-master` folder anywhere on the page to import it (do not delete the folder afterwards)
